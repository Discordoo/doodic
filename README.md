### ðŸŒŸ Features
* âš¡ ***Fast*** - Doodic uses QUIC at transport layer accelerating to speed of light(literally)
* ðŸ”’ ***Secure*** - Zero-trust is an axiom for Doodic. It is setup the way it will trust no one, until they prove they are trustworthy.
* ðŸ¤© ***Awesome DX*** - Developing complex and secure apps is usually complex. That's why programmers create a lot of abstractions. Some are cool, some are not. Doodic is the primer.
